# Breakout Game Project Plan for Playdate Console (Solo Developer)

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** Breakout Evolved
**Platform:** Playdate Console
**Development Language:** C89
**Estimated Duration:** 24 weeks

## 2. Development Approach

As a solo developer, you'll need to wear multiple hats (programmer, designer, artist, tester). The development process will be more iterative, with a focus on creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first, then expanding and polishing features.

## 3. Development Phases and Timeline

### Phase 1: Pre-production and Setup (2 weeks)
- Week 1-2:
  - Finalize GDD and project plan
  - Set up development environment
  - Learn and experiment with Playdate SDK
  - Create initial project structure

### Phase 2: Core Mechanics (6 weeks)
- Week 3-4:
  - Implement basic game loop
  - Develop paddle movement and physics
  - Create ball mechanics and basic collision detection
- Week 5-6:
  - Implement basic brick system
  - Develop score tracking and lives system
  - Create simple level loading mechanism
- Week 7-8:
  - Refine collision detection
  - Implement game over condition
  - Create basic UI elements (score display, lives)

### Phase 3: Enhanced Gameplay - Part 1 (6 weeks)
- Week 9-10:
  - Implement different brick types (normal, invincible, power-up)
  - Develop power-up system framework
- Week 11-12:
  - Implement first set of power-ups (SLOW_DOWN, EXTRA_LIFE, EXPAND)
  - Begin work on combo chain system
- Week 13-14:
  - Implement angle control for paddle hits
  - Refine power-up mechanics
  - Complete combo chain system

### Phase 4: Polish and Effects - Part 1 (3 weeks)
- Week 15-17:
  - Implement basic particle systems (brick breaking effect)
  - Add screen shake effect
  - Develop main menu and pause screen
  - Implement basic sound effects

### Phase 5: Enhanced Gameplay - Part 2 (4 weeks)
- Week 18-19:
  - Implement remaining brick types (hardened, explosive)
  - Add remaining power-ups (STICKY, REDUCE, MEGABALL, MULTIBALL)
- Week 20-21:
  - Develop paddle ram mechanic
  - Implement sudden death mode
  - Create high score system with initial entry

### Phase 6: Polish and Effects - Part 2 (3 weeks)
- Week 22:
  - Enhance particle systems (puffs, explosions)
  - Implement screen transitions (fade in/out)
- Week 23:
  - Add visual flourishes (blinking text, flashing bricks)
  - Implement directional arrow for sticky ball
- Week 24:
  - Integrate background music
  - Final gameplay balancing
  - Performance optimization

## 4. Milestones

1. End of Week 2: Development environment set up, basic understanding of Playdate SDK
2. End of Week 8: MVP with core game mechanics implemented
3. End of Week 14: Enhanced gameplay features (brick types, basic power-ups, combos)
4. End of Week 17: Basic polish and effects, playable demo
5. End of Week 21: All gameplay features implemented
6. End of Week 24: Game fully polished, tested, and optimized

## 5. Risk Management

1. **Risk:** Time management challenges
   **Mitigation:** Use time-boxing techniques, focus on core features first

2. **Risk:** Scope creep
   **Mitigation:** Regularly review and prioritize features, be willing to cut non-essential elements

3. **Risk:** Burnout
   **Mitigation:** Set realistic goals, take regular breaks, celebrate small victories

4. **Risk:** Technical challenges with Playdate SDK
   **Mitigation:** Allocate time for learning, use Playdate community resources for support

## 6. Tools and Resources

- Playdate SDK
- Version Control System (e.g., Git)
- Task Management Tool (e.g., Trello, Notion)
- Graphics Software (e.g., Aseprite for 1-bit art)
- Audio Software (e.g., Audacity)

## 7. Testing and Quality Assurance

- Implement unit tests for core mechanics
- Conduct regular playtesting sessions (at least bi-weekly)
- Leverage Playdate community for beta testing in later stages

## 8. Submission and Launch

- Week 25: Final testing and bug fixes
- Week 26: Submit game to Playdate store
- Week 27-28: Address any feedback or required changes from Playdate team
- Week 29: Official launch
